# Hospital Analytics Dashboard
An interactive, end-to-end Hospital Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze and monitor healthcare performance metrics, patient satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This project helps healthcare administrators, hospital management, and analysts derive actionable insights from patient records and hospital service indicators.

## Project Overview
This dashboard transforms raw hospital data into insightful visualizations that cover patient demographics, clinical outcomes, financial metrics, and hospital performance indicators.

The analysis aims to:

Optimize hospital operations

Improve patient outcomes and satisfaction

Track resource utilization

Monitor staff and facility performance

Support data-driven healthcare decisions

## Dataset Details
The dataset contains detailed patient-level and hospital-level data with the following key columns:
